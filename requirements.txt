# Ensure these versions are compatible with your CUDA setup.
# You might need to install torch/torchaudio manually first using the specific CUDA version index URL from pytorch.org
# e.g., pip install torch torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118 (Replace cu118 with your CUDA version, e.g., cu121)

# Optional OCR Dependencies (for scanned PDFs)
# These are optional but highly recommended for better PDF text extraction
pytesseract
Pillow

# Common dependencies often used by TTS and related libraries for numerical processing and audio analysis.
# While TTS might install these automatically, listing them can sometimes help resolve environment issues.
# numpy
# librosa
